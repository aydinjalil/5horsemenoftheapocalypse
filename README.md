Project Description/Outline

I was exploring different indicators within the same dataset and there are interesting things. CO2 emission and GDP correlation in US and US versus developed countries. We are looking at different sources of the CO2 emissions and their correlation to CO2 emission per capita, etc. We can then relate it to the life expectancy as well or different indicators.

Research Question to Answer

Over time has CO2 emissions or renewable energy consumption of a country increased or decreased in relation to a countries GDP (If the country is considered developed or undeveloped)

Dataset to Be Used

World Development Indicator Dataset


Rough Breakdown of Tasks

1. List countries to consider (5 developed & 5 undeveloped countries)
2. Determine which indicators in the dataset are important
3. Compare & contrast
